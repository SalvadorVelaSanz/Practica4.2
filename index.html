                <p>I would like to note Mel Bochners passing on February 12, 2025.
                    He was a valued colleague, a brilliant interlocutor, never brought
                    less than his A game to studio visits and reviews, he had a voice
                    that brought insight to the conversation, and had an outstanding
                    sense of humor. I was fortunate to be his colleague. Students felt
                    fortunate for the exchange they shared. He never varnished his
                    truth. May he rest in peace.
